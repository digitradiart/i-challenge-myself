ADVANTAGES
	
    COMPILATION
    the execution of the translated code is usually faster;
    only the user has to have the compiler - the end-user may use the code without it;
    the translated code is stored using machine language - as it is very hard to understand it, your own inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret.

	
    INTERPRETATION
    you can run the code as soon as you complete it - there are no additional phases of translation;
    the code is stored using programming language, not the machine one - this means that it can be run on computers using different machine languages; you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.

DISADVANTAGES
	
    COMPILATION
    the compilation itself may be a very time-consuming process - you may not be able to run your code immediately after any amendment;
    you have to have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on.

	INTERPRETATION
    don't expect that interpretation will ramp your code to high speed - your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, so it can't be really fast;
    both you and the end user have to have the interpreter to run your code.
