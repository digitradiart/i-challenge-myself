# Level of difficulty

# Easy
# Objectives

#     becoming familiar with the inputting and outputting of data in Python;
#     evaluating simple expressions.

# Scenario

# Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

# The results have to be printed to the console.

# You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

# Test your code - does it produce the results you expect?

# We won't show you any test data - that would be too simple.

float1 = float(input("float: "))
float2 = float(input("float: "))

print(float1 + float2)
print(float1 - float2)
print(float1 * float2)
print(float1 / float2)

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
