Now start IDLE again.

    Click File, Open, point to the file you saved previously and let IDLE read it in.
    Try to run it again by pressing F5 when the editor window is active.

Python 3.7.0 IDLE - Running a program after removing parenthesis from the print() function

Every time you put the closing parenthesis in your program, IDLE will show the part of the text limited with a pair of corresponding parentheses. This helps you to remember to place them in pairs.

Remove the closing parenthesis again. The code becomes erroneous. It contains a syntax error now. IDLE should not let you run it.

Try to run the program again. IDLE will remind you to save the modified file. Follow the instructions.
